For my best Kaggle submission, I used a glm model.  After intially exploring the powers of the decision tree, I discovered that logistic regression would be more useful and accurate for our Kaggle competion.  That said, using the decision tree at first allowed me to see the most important variables in determining whether or not someone will default on a loan.  It turn out that all of the external surveys as well as the age of the prospective customers prove to be the most important factors.  Thus, I just created a glm model involving all of those factors and derived a solution that got me a score of 0.713 on Kaggle!
